Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Is this just a "let's rewrite in Rust" exercise for Kubernetes?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Absolutely not.

Khutulun's starting point is a complete rethinking of how to approach the problem space occupied by Kubernetes. It starts with very different principles. See [Design Choices](design) for more detail.

In fact, an early version of Khutulun was written in Go, like Kubernetes.

Why is it called "Khutulun"?
----------------------------

[Khutulun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khutulun) (Mongolian: Хотулун) was a Mongolian warrior princess, the daughter of Kaidu Khaan. Kaidu's seal is used as the logo for this project.

Khutulun's unusual life story was likely the inspiration for *Turandot*, the protagonist of Carlo Gozzi's [*commedia dell'arte* play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turandot_(Gozzi)), which in turn inspired [Giacomo Puccini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Puccini)'s [opera of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turandot).

And [Puccini](https://puccini.cloud) is Khutulun's TOSCA frontend.

See, it all makes perfect sense.

How do I pronounce "Khutulun"?
