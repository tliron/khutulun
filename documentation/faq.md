Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Why is it called "Khutulun"?
----------------------------

[Khutulun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khutulun) (Mongolian: Хотулун) was a Mongolian warrior princess, the daughter of Kaidu Khaan. Kaidu's seal is used as the logo for this project.

Khutulun's unusual life story was likely the inspiration for *Turandot*, the protagonist of Carlo Gozzi's [*commedia dell'arte* play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turandot_(Gozzi)), which in turn inspired [Giacomo Puccini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Puccini)'s [opera of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turandot).

And [Puccini](https://puccini.cloud) is Khutulun's TOSCA frontend.

See, it all makes perfect sense.
